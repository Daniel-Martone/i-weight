# I weight

I weight is a website that shows what would be your weight on different planets, stars and moons.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand math, I have not found any simple way to calculate weights on different astros, so I had to make it myself
- Fast website: the images on the website are fully optimized and uses 100% of the original file size
